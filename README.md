# ChangeBackground
Setting the background color of the picture/screen to match the screen/picture background

Using the ##Pygame module the program creates a list of pictures that are displayed one by one on the screen. The sequence is controlled by the user by pressing keys on the keyboard.
Depending on the userâ€™s preferences, the program allows you to discolor the background of the picture, thereby making it transparent, and also set the background for the entire screen using the background color of the picture.
